# Cardiac Geometries

This is a library for creating idealized cardiac geometries in FEniCS using `gmsh`. There is also some functionality for doing this with `mshr`, however, `mshr` is not really supported anymore.

This package can also output analytic fiber orientations.

Please read the documentation at http://computationalphysiology.github.io/cardiac_geometries for more info.
